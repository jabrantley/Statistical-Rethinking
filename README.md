# Statistical-Rethinking

This is a collection of notebooks that follows along with the textbook, [Statistical Rethinking](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/), and the [accompanying lecture videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdnMWdICdRs&list=PLDcUM9US4XdPz-KxHM4XHt7uUVGWWVSus). 

I'll add more information to this readme as I make progress on the exercises.
